A negative test statistic suggests better fit of the row model, in this case, Bertrand.

The appropriate critical values for each F-statistic depend on the number of instruments the researcher is using, as well as the value of the scaling parameter $\\rho$. In the above table, we see that the F-statistic is associated with a symbol of \"***\" for size. This means that the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null if it is true (Type-I error) is at most 7.5%. The same F-statistic is associated with \"^^^\" for power, meaning that the probability of rejecting the null if it is false is at least 95%. Therefore the instruments in this example are neither weak for size nor for power.\n",
