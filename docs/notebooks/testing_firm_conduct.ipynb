    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to use the :ref:`references: Nevo (2000)` fake cereal data which is provided in the [PyBLP](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package. PyBLP has excellent [documentation](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) including a thorough tutorial for estimating demand on this dataset which can be found [here](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_notebooks/tutorial/nevo.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the data are originally designed to illustrate demand estimation. Thus, the following caveats should be kept in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The application in this tutorial only serves the purpose to illustrate how pyRVtest works. The results we show should not be used to infer conduct or any other economic feature about the cereal industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To test conduct, a researcher generally needs data on both cost shifters, and strong excluded instruments. As the data was designed to perform demand estimation, it does not necessarily have the features that are desirable to test conduct in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hence, the specifications that we use below, including the specification of firm cost and the candidate conducts models, are just shown for illustrative purposes and may not be appropriate for the economic context of the cereal industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial proceeds in the following steps:\n",

    "* [Load the main dataset](#Load-the-main-dataset)\n",

The important product characteristics for demand estimation in this data set are `price`, `sugar`, and `mushy`."

We are also including the variable `sugar` as an observed cost shifter and this variable must be in the `product_data`.

Thus, we have defined the instrument formulation as `pyRVtest.Formulation('0 + demand_instruments0 + demand_instruments1')`.  Here, `0` means no constant and this should always be specified as a 0.  Both `demand_instruments0` and `demand_instruments1` must also be in the `product_data`.  It is possible to test conduct separately for more than one set of instruments as shown in the example below.\n",

The first model is specified as `pyRVtest.ModelFormulation(model_downstream='bertrand', ownership_downstream='firm_ids')` `model_downstream = 'bertrand'` indicates that retail prices are set according to Bertrand.  `ownership_downstream='firm_ids'` specifies that the ownership matrix in each market should be built from the variable `firm_id` in the `product_data`.  For testing more than two models, see the example below.

Details on these objects and how they are computed can be found in [Duarte, Magnolfi, SÃ¸lvsten, and Sullivan (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06720).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first part of the table reports the pairwise RV test statistic given the specified adjustments to the standard errors. In this example, there is one RV test statistic as we are only testing two models.  Elements on and below the main diagonal in the RV and F-statistic block are set to \"nan\" since both RV tests and F-statistics are symmetric for a pair of models. A negative test statistic suggests better fit of the row model, in this case, Bertrand.  The critical values for each $T^{RV}$ are $\\pm$ 1.96, so the RV test cannot reject the null of equal fit of the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second part reports the pairwise F-statistics, again with the specified adjustments to the standard errors.  The symbols underneath each F-statistic indicate whether the corresponding F-statistic is weak for size or for power. The appropriate critical values for each F-statistic depend on the number of instruments the researcher is using, as well as the value of the scaling parameter $\\rho$. In the above table, we see that the F-statistic is associated with a symbol of \"***\" for size. This means that the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null if it is true (Type-I error) is at most 7.5%. The same F-statistic is associated with \"^^^\" for power, meaning that the probability of rejecting the null if it is false is at least 95%. Therefore the instruments in this example are neither weak for size nor for power.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, the p-values associated with the model confidence set are reported. To interpret these $p$-values, a researcher chooses a significance level $\\alpha$.  Any model whose $p$-value is below $\\alpha$ is rejected.  The models with $p$-values above $\\alpha$ cannot be rejected by the instruments and the researcher should conclude that they have equal fit.  Thus, in this example, for an $\\alpha = 0.05$, the researcher is left with a model confidence set containing both models.\n",

Each testing results panel, corresponding to a set of instruments, reports in three separate blocks the RV test statistics for each pair of models, effective F-statistic for each pair of models, and MCS p-value for the row model.

    "In interpreting these results, note that instruments z_0 and z_1 contain 2 and 3 instruments respectively.  Since the number of instruments is between 2-9, there are no size distortions above 0.025 for any model pair and instruments are strong for size.  However, the instruments are weak for power as each pairwise F-statistic is below the critical value corresponding to best-case power of 0.95.  Unsurprisingly then, no model is ever rejected from the MCS. These results reflect the fact that the data used in the tutorial do not provide the appropriate variation to test conduct. As such, the results should not be interpreted as to draw any conclusion about the nature of conduct in this empirical environment. We plan to include a more economically interesting example with future releases.\n"
